# django_todolist

This project is a simple Django application that acts as a simple to-do-list. There is one text field that can be typed within and added to the list in reverse order (newest entries on top) using the 'add' button. Each entry can then be deleted individually using the corresponding 'delete' button.


This Django application was created following the 'Build Three Django Projects - Python Course' published by freeCodeCamp.org https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPtScmB8CgA
